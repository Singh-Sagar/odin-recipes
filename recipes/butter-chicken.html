    <p>Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani) is a classic North Indian dish featuring marinated chicken cooked in a creamy tomato-based sauce with spices like garam masala, cumin, and coriander</p>
    <p>Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani) is a beloved dish that originated in Delhi, India, and has since become a staple in Indian restaurants worldwide. This creamy, flavorful curry features tender pieces of chicken that are first marinated in a blend of spices, then grilled or roasted to perfection. The chicken is then simmered in a rich, velvety sauce made with tomatoes, butter, cream, and a carefully curated mix of aromatic spices like garam masala, cumin, and coriander.</p>
    <p>The sauce is the star of the dish, with its vibrant red color and mild heat coming from the use of Kashmiri chili powder. The combination of tomatoes, butter, and cream creates a luxurious texture that coats each piece of chicken, infusing it with the complex flavors of the spices. Butter Chicken is a relatively mild curry compared to many other Indian dishes, making it a popular choice for those who prefer a more subtle heat. It's typically served with basmati rice or naan bread, allowing diners to soak up every last drop of the delectable sauce</p>
