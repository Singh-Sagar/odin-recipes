    <h1>Indian Chicken Curry</h1>
    <img src="../images/indiancurry.webp" alt="indian chicken curry">
    <p>This Indian-inspired creamy chicken curry recipe is similar to a curry I had in India. The aromatic spices and flavors are a delight to the senses! Delicious with fresh naan and basmati rice.</p>
    <p>Indian Chicken Curry is a beloved dish that features tender pieces of chicken simmered in a rich, flavorful sauce. The chicken is first marinated in a blend of spices, yogurt, garlic, and ginger, which helps infuse it with flavor and keep it moist during cooking. It is then simmered in a sauce made with a base of onions, tomatoes, and a carefully curated mix of aromatic spices like garam masala, cumin, coriander, and chili powder.</p>
    <p>The sauce gets its vibrant red color and mild heat from Kashmiri chili powder, while the addition of butter or ghee, cream, and fenugreek leaves creates a luxurious, velvety texture. Indian Chicken Curry is typically served with basmati rice or naan bread, allowing diners to soak up every last drop of the delectable sauce. It is a relatively mild curry compared to many other Indian dishes, making it a popular choice for those who prefer a more subtle heat.
