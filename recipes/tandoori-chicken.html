    <p>Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home. Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob, and a cucumber salad.</p>
    <p>Tandoori Chicken is a beloved Indian dish featuring chicken marinated in a flavorful yogurt-based sauce and cooked in a tandoor, a traditional cylindrical clay oven. The chicken is first skinned and then marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and seasonings like cayenne pepper, red chili powder, turmeric, and tandoori masala. The marinated chicken is then skewered and cooked at high temperatures in the tandoor, which gives it a smoky flavor and charred spots.</p>
    <p>Tandoori Chicken can be served as an appetizer or a main course, often accompanied by naan flatbread. It is also used as the base for numerous cream-based curries like butter chicken. The dish became popular worldwide after being introduced by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s. Today, tandoori chicken is a staple in Indian restaurants around the globe, with many variations like chicken tikka and chicken tikka masala also becoming popular.</p>
