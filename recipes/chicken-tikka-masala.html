        Chicken tikka masala made easy with this great-tasting recipe — simply marinate chicken breast in yogurt and spices and then simmer in a tomato cream sauce. Serve with rice or warm pita bread.
    </p>
    <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a popular dish that combines the flavors of tandoori-style chicken with a creamy, tomato-based sauce. The dish originated in the United Kingdom, likely created by a Bangladeshi chef to cater to British tastes, but it has since become a staple in Indian restaurants worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>The dish begins with chunks of chicken that are first marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and herbs, then skewered and cooked in a tandoor oven until charred and tender. These chicken tikka pieces are then added to a rich, creamy sauce made with tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, and a blend of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The sauce gets its signature orange-red color and mild heat from the addition of chili powder and paprika. Chicken Tikka Masala is typically served with basmati rice or naan bread, making it a satisfying and flavorful meal.</p>
